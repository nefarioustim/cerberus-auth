Cerberus
==========
Authentication and Authorisation Microservice
----------

Cerberus aims to provide a basic user authentication and authorisation
microservice for any project that might need it. Having had to build this
several times in the past, I decided it was probably a good idea to create a
reusuable microservice that I could spin-up in any projects I am working on.
